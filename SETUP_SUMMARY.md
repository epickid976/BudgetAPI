# ✅ Email Implementation Complete!

## 🎉 What's Been Added

I've implemented a **complete, production-ready email system** for your Budget API using **Resend** (free tier: 3,000 emails/month).

### New Files Created:
1. **`/api/src/services/email.ts`** - Email service with 3 functions:
   - `sendVerificationEmail()` - Send email verification links
   - `sendPasswordResetEmail()` - Send password reset links  
   - `sendWelcomeEmail()` - Send welcome message after verification

2. **`EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Complete setup instructions

### Files Updated:
1. **`/api/src/config/env.ts`** - Added email environment variables
2. **`/routes/authRoutes.ts`** - Integrated email service into all auth routes
3. **`package.json`** - Added `resend` package

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Options)

### Option 1: Development Mode (No Setup)
Just run your app as-is! Emails will log to console:

```bash
npm start
```

When a user registers, you'll see:
```
📧 EMAIL NOT CONFIGURED - Verification email would be sent to: test@example.com
Verification URL: http://localhost:3001/verify-email?token=abc123...
```

### Option 2: Production Mode (5 min setup)
1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com) (FREE)
2. Get your API key
3. Add to your `.env`:
   ```bash
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key_here
   EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev
   APP_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```
4. Restart your app - emails will be sent!

## 💰 Cost: FREE!

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Required for production
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev
APP_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Or for Render production:
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@yourdomain.com
APP_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com
```

**Note:** If `RESEND_API_KEY` is not set, emails will log to console (perfect for development!).

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Read** `EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed setup instructions
2. **Test locally** (works without Resend - logs to console)
3. **Sign up** for Resend when ready for production
4. **Configure** environment variables
5. **Deploy** to Render with updated env vars

---

## 🧪 Test It Now!

Start your server:
```bash
npm start
```

Register a new user:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

Check your console - you'll see the verification email details!
